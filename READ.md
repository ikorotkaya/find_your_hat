This is a simple JavaScript game called "Hat Game" that runs in the console. The goal of the game is to navigate through a field to find the hat symbol (^) without falling into any holes (O).

How to Play:
1. Run the JavaScript code in a console environment.
2. You will see a grid representing the field. Your current position is marked with an asterisk *(*)*.
3. Enter your moves by typing the letters *u, d, l, *or *r* to move up, down, left, or right, respectively. Press Enter after each move.
4. Try to navigate through the field without falling into a hole *(O)* or going outside the field boundaries.
5. If you find the hat symbol *(^)*, you win the game!
6. If you fall into a hole or go outside the field boundaries, the game ends and you lose.

Instructions:
1. The code provided defines a *Field class* that represents the game field. 
2. The class has the following methods:

- **constructor(grid)**: Initializes the field with the provided grid and sets the player's starting position.
- **print()**: Prints the current state of the field grid.
- **nextMove()**: Prompts the player to enter the next move and updates the player's position accordingly.
- **playGame()**: Starts the game loop and handles the game logic.
- **isHat()**: Checks if the current position contains the hat symbol (^).
- **isHole()**: Checks if the current position contains a hole (O).
**isInBounds()**: Checks if the current position is within the field boundaries.
- **static generateField(height, width, percentage)**: Generates a random field with the specified dimensions and hole percentage. The hat symbol is placed at a random position, and additional holes are added randomly.

To start a new game, an instance of the Field class is created with a randomly generated field using the generateField method. The game is then played by calling the playGame method on the created instance.

Feel free to modify the code to adjust the field size, hole percentage, or any other aspects of the game as per your preference. Have fun playing the Hat Game!
